# Intro to Git and Github

## Course description
Natalie is making changes y'all!
Ever make changes that broke your code and forgot how your code worked before? Want to work with someone on a code project, but aren't sure who has the latest version of a particular file? Version control can solve these problems and more!

Git is a popular version control application that can track your code changes and make it easier to collaboration on a project. Win win! This session will introduce the basics of version control, how to use Git to keep track of your changes to a project, and how to use GitHub (a hosting service) to collaborate with other developers.

We will start the class by setting up your GitHub account and configuring git on your machine. We will then go through a lecture and exercises to help you get started with Git and GitHub!

### Prerequisites:

This class will not use actual code when committing to a GitHub repository, so no need to worry about knowing a particular programming language. A willingness to use the command line is necessary; we will be changing directories, listing directory contents, and using git from the command line throughout the class (what's the command line? Or take a class). You should bring your own computer to class (or let us know if you need to borrow one) and have administrative privileges for installing software. Also, don't forget to bring a power supply.


### Tech requirements:

 - Your laptop (Mac, PC, or Linux are all okay).
 - A modern web browser - either Chrome or Firefox with Firebug installed.
 - A text editor. We recommend Sublime Text 2 (free; available for Mac, PC, and Linux).


### Topics covered:

This workshop will cover:

 - the basic concepts of version control
 - git commands to track changes to a small project
 - how to use GitHub
 - the basics of collaborating on projects with other developers
